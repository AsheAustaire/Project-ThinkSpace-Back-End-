# Project: Thinkspace
:cloud: A virtual space for annonymously sharing ideas. :cloud:


## Overview
 
### Project: Thinkspace is a virtual reality environment allowing users to share and view ideas, annonymously.

I'm inspired to create a 3D virtual space where an individual can add an idea reflecting on any topic or question without having to consider who will see it and how they may be judged. That same user may then search the ThinkSpace database for similar ideas, based on various filters. I see this being useful anywhere from an office that wants to promote employees to share opinions to being an annonymous social network including ideas from around the world.

Users have their own **spaces** which would be dynamically altered by a custom **filter interface**. When a user sets and saves their filter interface, their **3D virtual environment** would find relevant ideas and introduce them to our users space. The user may then **interact** with the ideas, further modify the filters, or even **add** their own ideas. 

Current and Future features are displayed in bold ^^^.
